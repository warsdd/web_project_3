                            shores of the Dnipro river. Of course, no one in their right mind would swim in the river,
                            unless they grew up here, in which case they've probably tried it at some point. Summers are
                            hot
                            here, and the winters are drafty, but the fall and the spring are absolutely amazing.</p>
                        <p class="place__paragraph">The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet
                            architecture, all of it sprinkled with modified balconies. If you're on the right bank of
                            the
                            Dnipro, the landscape is difficult to traverse for people on bikes and those wearing heels.
                            The
                            left bank is considered far less interesting and prestigious though, even by people who live

                            rock that juts out into the sea. It is thought to have been built by Llewelyn the Great in
                            the
                            13th century. Some 900 years later, the self-styled Pearl of Wales on the Shores of
                            Snowdonia
                            has become a popular tourist destination during the summer months.</p>
                        <p class="place__paragraph">A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy the

                            best ice cream at Cadwalader's, whose secret ingredient is rumored to be locally sourced
                            seaweed. Another claim to fame is the fact that Criccieth won the Wales in Bloom award for
                            five
                            years in a row for its spectacular floral displays around town. It was also home to David

                            George, the only Welshman ever to hold the office of Prime Minister of the UK.</p>

                            the state, and visitors will find plenty of shopping opportunities: shops with handmade

                            candles, wood items, galleries, glass studios, and more. The town holds an annual festival
                            celebrating "spoonbread", a local dish made with cornbread and served with a wooden spoon.

                            the first to be coeducational. Somewhat uniquely, it charges no tuition — every student

                            Muramvya was the royal capital and in 2007, because of its cultural and natural landscape,
                            it

                            coldest places in the province. But that cool breeze allows for one of the largest
                            plantations
                            of tea and coffee in the country, which make up the bulk of Burundi's exports.</p>

                        <p class="place__paragraph">Glenrothes is a town in the heart of Fife, in the central belt of
                            Scotland. Situated on the
                            east coast, it is one of only five New Towns in Scotland, made up of villages and farms
                            joined
                            together in the late 1940s to serve as a base for industry in the county. The town takes its
                            name from the Earl of Rothes, who owned much of the land on which the new town has been
                            built. Glenrothes comes
                            from
                            the Scots "glen" or valley, and "rothes" or river.</p>
                        <p class="place__paragraph">Although it is largely known for its defunct mining industry, paper

                            and

                            and
                            well worth exploring.
                            The northern areas of the town sit on the slopes of Falkland Hill, the easternmost pap of
                            the
                            Lomond Hills regional park, which offers stunning views of the surrounding countryside from
                            the
                            top, if you're lucky enough to get good weather!</p>
