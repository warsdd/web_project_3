                    <p class="places__paragraph">Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located on the
                        shores of the Dnipro river. Of course, no one in their right mind would swim in the river,
                        unless they grew up here, in which case they've probably tried it at some point. Summers are hot
                        here, and the winters are drafty, but the fall and the spring are absolutely amazing.</p>
                    <p class="places__paragraph">The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet
                        architecture, all of it sprinkled with modified balconies. If you're on the right bank of the
                        Dnipro, the landscape is difficult to traverse for people on bikes and those wearing heels. The
                        left bank is considered far less interesting and prestigious though, even by people who live on
                        the far outskirts of the right one.</p>

                    <p class="places__paragraph">The medieval ruin of Cricieth Castle overlooks the town below from a
                        rock that juts out into the sea. It is thought to have been built by Llewelyn the Great in the
                        13th century. Some 900 years later, the self-styled Pearl of Wales on the Shores of Snowdonia
                        has become a popular tourist destination during the summer months.</p>
                    <p class="places__paragraph">A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy the world's
                        best ice cream at Cadwalader's, whose secret ingredient is rumored to be locally sourced
                        seaweed. Another claim to fame is the fact that Cricieth won the Wales in Bloom award for five
                        years in a row for its spectacular floral displays around town. It was also home to David Lloyd
                        George, the only Welshman ever to hold the office of Prime Minister of the UK.</p>

                    <p class="places__paragraph">Berea is a small town located in the central part of Kentucky. The town
                        is surrounded by beautiful forests and countryside. It's known as the arts and crafts capital of
                        the state, and visitors will find plenty of shopping opportunities: shops with handmade jewelry,
                        candles, wood items, galleries, glass studios, and more. The town holds an annual festival
                        celebrating "spoonbread", a local dish made with cornbread and served with a wooden spoon.</p>
                    <p class="places__paragraph">However, it's probably known best for the local college. Berea College
                        was founded in 1855 and was the first college in the south to be racially integrated, as well as
                        the first to be coeducational. Somewhat uniquely, it charges no tuition — every student receives
                        a full-tuition scholarship. </p>

                    <p class="places__paragraph">Muramvya is one of the 18 provinces of Burundi. In the kingdom era,
                        Muramvya was the royal capital and in 2007, because of its cultural and natural landscape, it
                        was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. It is located in the center of Burundi,
                        between the two capitals (economic and political).</p>
                    <p class="places__paragraph">The weather is rather chilly at night, but during the day, you would
                        think you're in heaven. At 2,665 meters (8,743 ft) above sea level, Mount Teza is one of the
                        coldest places in the province. But that cool breeze allows for one of the largest plantations
                        of tea and coffee in the country, which make up the bulk of Burundi's exports.</p>
                    <p class="places__paragraph">The Kibira National Park, one of the largest wildlife reserves for
                        apes, overlaps four provinces, including Muramvya. This National Park lies at the apex of the
                        beautiful mountains of the Congo-Nile Divide, ranging between 1,550 and 2,660 meters of
                        altitude. It is filled with beautiful vegetation, and a source for the various rivers and
                        streams which provide water around the country.</p>

                    <p class="places__paragraph">Glenrothes is a town in the heart of Fife, Scotland. Situated on the
                        east coast, it is one of only five new towns in Scotland, made up of villages and farms joined
                        together in the late 1940s to serve as a base for industry in the county. The name comes from
                        the Scots "glen" or valley, and "rothes", or river.</p>
                    <p class="places__paragraph">Although it is largely known for its mining industry, paper mill, and
                        sombre post-war architecture, the surrounding countryside and villages are quiet, green, and well worth exploring.
                        The northern areas of the town sit on the slopes of Falkland Hill, the easternmost pap of the
                        Lomond Hills regional park, which offers stunning views of the surrounding countryside from the top if you're lucky with the weather!</p>
